## Description:
WavesInABox is an artwork that explores the border between chaos and order in a surface of water.Imagine a body of water enclosed in a box. If the water is touched a wave will be created. This wave will travel through the water until it hits the wall. When this happens it will reflect and interact with other waves. Will the result be orderly patterns or disorderly movement.

WavesInABox is a real-time wavefront simulator written from scratch. The simulation can be viewed in 3D. The simulation uses a finite difference method to simulate the [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation). To achieve good performance compute shaders are utilized.
